# MKronoSphere - Session Memories & Progress Tracker

## Project Overview
**Codename:** MKronoSphere  
**Purpose:** Sacred timekeeper and timeline orchestrator for the Sovereign Network  
**Status:** Initial Build Phase  
**Created:** $(date)

## Core Architecture Decisions
- **Modular Design:** Three primary modules (chronoLogger, temporalResonator, pulseBroadcaster)
- **Time Zones:** Support for Sacred Time Zones (Full Moon, Equinox, Sunrise/Sunset, Custom Events)
- **Public Release:** MIT License with Sovereign Network branding
- **Technology Stack:** Node.js with TypeScript for modularity and type safety

## Build Progress
- [x] Initialize project structure
- [x] Create core modules
- [x] Implement time visualization
- [x] Build README and documentation
- [x] Create CLI interface
- [x] Add examples and configuration
- [ ] Configure GitHub release

## Key Features Implemented
1. **chronoLogger:** ✅ Event tracking with temporal tagging and intelligent categorization
2. **temporalResonator:** ✅ Multi-repo synchronization with retry mechanisms and concurrent processing
3. **pulseBroadcaster:** ✅ Signal emission system with multi-channel broadcasting
4. **Sacred Time Zones:** ✅ Default astronomical and custom event configurations with precise calculations
5. **Real-time Console:** ✅ Live feedback and visualization with colored output
6. **CLI Interface:** ✅ Command-line interface for system interaction
7. **TypeScript Support:** ✅ Full type safety and comprehensive API
8. **Modular Architecture:** ✅ Clean separation of concerns with event-driven coordination

## Session Notes
- Building as public-facing framework for timeline orchestration
- Focus on lightweight, modular architecture
- Include comprehensive documentation following quantum-detail standards
